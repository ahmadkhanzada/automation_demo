   - **Visibility**: Public (recommended for demo purposes)
   - **Initialize**: ❌ Don't check any initialization options (we have files ready)
4. Click "Create repository"

### 2. Initialize Local Git Repository

Open terminal in your project directory and run:

```bash
cd c:\Users\azz_d\PycharmProjects\automation_demo
git init
git add .
git commit -m "feat: initial commit with complete automation demo project

- Add monorepo structure with backend and frontend workspaces
- Implement Node.js/Express API with JWT authentication  
- Create React frontend with authentication and CRUD operations

```

### 3. Connect to GitHub

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username:

```bash
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/ahmadkhanzada/automation_demo.git
git push -u origin main
```

### 4. Configure Repository Settings

After pushing, go to your repository on GitHub and configure:

#### 📋 General Settings
- Go to Settings → General
- Ensure "Issues" and "Projects" are enabled
- Set default branch to `main`

#### 🛡️ Branch Protection
- Go to Settings → Branches
- Add rule for `main` branch:

  - ✅ Require branches to be up to date before merging
  - ✅ Include administrators

#### 🏷️ Topics
- Go to Settings → General
- Add topics: `automation`, `testing`, `react`, `nodejs`, `express`, `jest`, `playwright`, `monorepo`, `demo`

### 5. Test GitHub Actions

1. Make a small change to trigger CI:
   ```bash
   echo "# Automation Demo Project" > README_TEST.md
   git add README_TEST.md
   git commit -m "test: trigger CI pipeline"
   git push
   ```

2. Go to Actions tab in your GitHub repository
3. Verify that the CI workflow runs successfully
4. Delete the test file:
   ```bash
   git rm README_TEST.md
   git commit -m "cleanup: remove test file"
   git push
   ```
