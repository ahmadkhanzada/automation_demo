### 🔒 Security Measures

This project implements the following security measures:

#### Backend Security
- Input validation and sanitization
- Authentication token validation
- CORS configuration
- Error handling without information leakage

#### Frontend Security
- XSS protection through React's built-in escaping
- Secure token storage practices
- Input validation
- Secure API communication

#### Development Security
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Secure coding practices
- Regular security reviews

### 🚨 Known Security Considerations

This is a **demonstration project** and includes the following security considerations:

⚠️ **Not for Production Use**: This project is designed for educational and demonstration purposes. It should not be used in production environments without significant security hardening.

#### Current Limitations:
- Uses in-memory storage (data is not persistent)
- Simplified authentication (not production-ready)
- No rate limiting implemented
- No HTTPS enforcement
- No input sanitization beyond basic validation
- Test credentials are hardcoded

#### Recommended Security Enhancements for Production:
- Implement proper database security
- Use robust authentication (OAuth2, JWT with proper secret management)
- Add rate limiting and DDoS protection
- Implement HTTPS/TLS
- Add comprehensive input validation and sanitization
- Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
- Implement proper logging and monitoring
- Add CSRF protection
- Use security headers (helmet.js)
- Regular security audits and penetration testing
